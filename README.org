#+TITLE: omdb

An OCaml Memory-mapped Database.

* Rationale

This is an experiment into a multicore capable, Mirage ready database implemented in OCaml.

Inspiration is taken from [[https://www.symas.com/lmdb][LMDB]], a key-value store implemented in C that scales linearly with readers.

* Development environment

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  guix shell -Df guix.scm
#+END_SRC

* Notes

** Memory-map 

The on-disk database is memory-mapped. This seems to also be available on Mirage (see [[https://mirage.io/blog/xen-block-devices-with-mirage][Creating Xen block devices with MirageOS]]).
