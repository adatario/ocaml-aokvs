#+SUBTITLE: An ordered-key-value-store

Aokvs is an ordered key-value store implemented in pure OCaml using the [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio][eio]].

**WARNING** Aokvs is an ongoing experiment and is not yet useable.

* Rationale and Inspiration 

This is an experiment into a multicore capable, MirageOS ready database that can be used for complex queries.

Inspiration includes:

- [[https://www.symas.com/lmdb][LMDB]]: An ordered key-value store implemented in C. The basic data-structure (B-tree) and the page layout is inspired by LMDB.
- [[https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt][Bolt]]: An ordered key-value store implemented in Go. Bolt is inspired by LMDB.
- [[https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/leanstore.pdf][LeanStore]]: More recent research on how to use modern hardware efficiently.
